# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project that aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model. The project utilizes various data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the key factors influencing house prices and builds a predictive model to estimate the sale price of houses based on their characteristics.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: A dataset consisting of 1,460 entries and 81 features, including various house attributes and sale prices.
- **Objective**: To create a machine learning regression model that predicts house prices.
- **Methods**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using pandas.
2. **Data Exploration**: Detailed analysis and visualization of data features and distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Development and selection of the most relevant features for prediction.
4. **Model Building**: Training of models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance assessment using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Installation
